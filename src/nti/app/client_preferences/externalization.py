"""
Support for externalizing :mod:`zope.preference` objects.

These objects are used with schemas (defined by interfaces) that
define the possible preference values. The values are not directly
stored in the preference objects, but instead in annotations on the
owner of the preference; these are read and written as required. The
preference objects themselves implement
:class:`zope.preference.interfaces.IPreferenceGroup` as well as the
schema for the preference value.

See :class:`PreferenceGroupObjectIO` for more information.

.. note:: Because the preference schema is also implemented by the preference object,
  one should generally not also have externalizers registered
  for that interface. In other words, using exactly the same interface for
  a preference schema as is implemented by a model object is probably not a good
  idea.

    Externalizes preference groups using the existing interface schema.
    Our main job is to determine the correct schema to use and

    Restrictions
    ============

    Preference groups (other than the root group) will not be written
    out unless their schema (or a parent schema) has a tagged value defined by
    :const:`TAG_EXTERNAL_PREFERENCE_GROUP` equal to 'read'. If the preference
    group should also be able to be updated by the client, the value
    should be 'write'.


    Class Names and MimeTypes
    =========================

    A second job is to determine the externally visible 'Class'
    and 'MimeType' values. We have no solid convention for deriving
    that from interface names, and in any case, in order to find
    the given incoming object from those values, we echo the (package-like)
    values of the preference group id (modified for convention).
    This overrides anything the specific subclass of PreferenceGroup
    or schema interface specified.
